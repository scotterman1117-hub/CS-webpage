                Lolalytics is a website I use to find stats and data about the game I play called League of Legends. The site was created by people who enjoy gathering stats related to the game from every region, and is not run for profit. The stats can be sorted by region, rank, and the patch/date relevant to each portion of stats. Another valuable aspect of the website is that it shows the delta of each stat, showing how each patch influences a champions or items winrate, pickrate, and banrate.

               The reason I use the website is that is has the most accurate data out of all the competing sites that also display data for League. It also has the largest amount of specific data, such as matchup specific stats and item specific stats. An example of this is the winrate of each item if built as your third item vs your second item. Another reason I like it is the UI is really easy to use and I never really get lost when navigating the website.
